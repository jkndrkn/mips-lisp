This project runs in SLIME on EMACS.

If EMACS 21.3 is not installed on your system, install a complete Lisp environment by installing Lispbox.
Lispbox combines EMACS, a Common Lisp implementation, and SLIME.

Note: Lispbox was used for all development and testing.

If EMACS 21.3 is installed on your system and installing Lispbox is not desirable, install Common Lisp 2.37 and SLIME.
Be sure to carefully follow the installation instructions for SLIME.

Note: This project has *not* been tested with the preceeding method, but it should work.

Once these components have been installed and have been verified to work, you are ready to proceed with running the assembler, simulator, and benchmarks.
